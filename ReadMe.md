## Usage
I will be adding the intersections indivdually in directories with their name.

Currently to run it just navigate to the desired intersection's directory and run 
``` bash
$ start road.html
```
## Future
This project is in a very early state and will only continue to improve as I improve my css and Javascript skills.
